**Debrief:**

1.  I’d reorganize the code into separate modules for authentication, API interactions, and data processing, making it easier to read and maintain.
2.  To further improve clarity, I’d unify naming conventions and ensure every function or variable name clearly communicates its purpose.
3.  I’d also add more robust logging—preferably structured logs—to capture detailed information for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
4.  For better resilience, I’d refine error handling to cover edge cases and retry scenarios more gracefully.
5.  To optimize performance, I’d parallelize batch processing with controlled concurrency while closely watching HubSpot’s rate limits.
6.  Further, implementing or expanding automated tests would help quickly detect regressions and validate new features.
7.  I’d also revisit the commented-out domain-saving logic to ensure data updates are reliably persisted when needed.
8.  Finally, a systematic job scheduler (like a dedicated queue or cron-based approach) would make daily runs more robust, with fewer manual interventions or missed pulls.
